# "Installing" flash-attention
# - Not sure if branch `main_perf` is actually better,
#   but everyone seems to be using it, so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# - As far as I understood, we're not actually installing-installing
#   flash-attention, but we're telling it to use the Triton backend/implementation
#   which is already included in the rocm/pytorch image (built by amd),
#   so the lines below are executed pretty fast.
# - That ^ is what the env variable seems to be for.
